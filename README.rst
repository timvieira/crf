Conditional Random Fields (CRF)

SETUP
=====
You will need to grab my **arsenal** repository and stick it on your
python path.

Example data for citation segmentation is included as well as very simple
feature extraction (not a serious feature set).


TODO
====
  - L2 regularization for sgd. Don't know how to do it with perceptron.
  - look at Leon Buttou's and Charles Sutton's notes on learning rates for sgd.
  - L-BFGS optimization
  - parameter averaging for sgd and perceptron
